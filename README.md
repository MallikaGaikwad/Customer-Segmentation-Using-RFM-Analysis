# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING RFM (RECENCY, FREQUENCY,MONETARY) ANALYSIS

The dataset employed in this analysis originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
encompassing transactional records spanning from December 1st, 2010 to December 9th, 2011.
These transactions represent a UK-based non-store online retail business specializing in unique
all-occasion gifts. It is important to note that this dataset captures actual transactional data,
reflecting purchases and interactions of customers, including a considerable clientele of
wholesalers.

Acknowledging its source from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the data was made
accessible by Dr. Daqing Chen, Director of the Public Analytics group, School of Engineering,
London South Bank University, UK (chend '@' lsbu.ac.uk). The dataset's content and the
timeframe it covers offer a unique opportunity for analyses spanning various dimensions, such
as time series, clustering, classification, and more.

In aligning with best practices for data preprocessing and ensuring its reliability for analytical
purposes, meticulous steps were undertaken. These encompassed initial data acquisition,
thorough examination, and rigorous cleaning procedures. During this process, redundant or
irrelevant columns unrelated to RFM analysis, such as references and non-pertinent date
records, were identified and subsequently removed, optimizing the dataset for subsequent
analysis. Additionally, the focus on feature extraction techniques was maintained to derive
valuable insights from the data, reinforcing its suitability for RFM segmentation and other
pertinent analyses.

It is imperative to recognize that while the dataset provides a comprehensive overview of
transactions and customer interactions, the accuracy and efficacy of analyses conducted are
contingent upon the quality of the original records maintained in the database. Any concerns
regarding data quality or specific data points are duly acknowledged and can be addressed
through comments or inquiries.
